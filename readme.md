# StockMaster 

> An intelligent, AI-powered Inventory Management System (IMS) that streamlines stock operations and replaces manual registers.

## 🚀 Overview
StockMaster helps businesses manage incoming and outgoing stock in real-time. Unlike traditional systems, StockMaster utilizes **Google Gemini AI** to automate data entry—users can simply snap a picture of a vendor invoice, and the system automatically parses and updates the inventory, reducing manual error and entry time.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** Node.js + Python
* **Database:** Firebase Realtime Database (NoSQL)
* **AI Engine:** Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (via Google Generative AI SDK)

## ✨ Key Features
* **📊 Real-Time Dashboard:** View KPIs like Total Stock, Low Stock Alerts, and Pending Deliveries instantly.
* **🤖 AI Invoice Scanning:** Upload an image of a paper invoice, and Gemini extracts the items and quantities to auto-fill receipt forms.
* **📉 Stock Movements:** Track Receipts (Incoming), Deliveries (Outgoing), and Adjustments with a full audit ledger.
* **⚡ Instant Search:** Filter products by SKU, Category, or Location.

<!-- ## 🔌 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/api/dashboard` | Fetches KPI stats (Total products, Low stock count). |

<!-- ## 🧠 How the AI Works

1.  User uploads an image of a handwritten or printed invoice.
2.  The backend sends the image to **Gemini 1.5 Flash**.
3.  We use a strict system prompt to ensure Gemini returns **pure JSON** data.
4.  The frontend populates the "Receipts" form automatically. -->
